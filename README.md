# gpt_chatbot_template
A simple boilerplate for chatting with OpenAI's models. The example system prompt will make the model switch the conversation topic to cats all the time.

# Usage

- In the code, add your personal organisation and API keys
- Make sure Python3 is installed
- Install the dependency `openai`, e.g. `pip install openai`
- Run the program `python gpt_boilerplate.py`
- Change the settings and system prompts in the code to customise it to your needs

Note: GPT-4 models are more expensive than GPT-3 ones. Pricing can be found here: https://openai.com/pricing. Regular conversations should cost no more than a couple of cents.
